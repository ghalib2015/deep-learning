This is the github repository of deep learning OT1 project. </br>
It contains the models for the 3 tasks. </br>
-The architectures are defined on classifier.py with 3 models, one for each task. </br>
  - colorClassifier</br>
  - BoxClassifier</br>
  - SeqClassifier</br>
-The training was done with:
  -training.py for color
  -training2.py for box
  -training3.py for sequence
-The evolution of the models can be visualized using tensorboard on runs directory, one for each model
