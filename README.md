# deep-learning OT1 project
This is the github repository of deep learning OT1 project. </br>
It contains the models for the 3 tasks. </br>
- The architectures are defined on classifier.py with 3 models, one for each task. </br>
  - colorClassifier</br>
  - BoxClassifier</br>
  - SeqClassifier</br>
- The training was done with:</br>
  - training.py for color</br>
  - training2.py for box</br>
  - training3.py for sequence</br>
- The evolution of the models can be visualized using tensorboard on runs directory, one for each model</br>
